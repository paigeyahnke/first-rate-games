# First-Rate Games
Don't know what to play? Find the best in genre for any year!

## Project Statement
First Rate Games is a web service that will give user's the number one games based on game genres for any given year. 
Our service is geared towards both novice and expert gamers. Regardless of one's gaming background, having 
historical gaming information will give that person ideas on other games they may be interested in as well as 
understanding the evolution of each game genre. Our service fulfills the need to for this unique
information without the pain of manually typing this information into a search engine. 


## Project Objectives
What we want to achieve with this web service is to create a simple user interface allowing for a user to input a 
year or range of years and a video game genre. This service uses IGDB's API to retrieve the game information. IGDB will
return more information than we need so we will filter that information out and only return the top rated games for the
year(s) the user has entered.
